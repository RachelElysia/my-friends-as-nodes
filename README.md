# Inspiration: Pointless Presentation Party
Yearly, my old house held a Holiday Pointless Presentation Party. With the party going digital during the pandemic, I decided to create a digital representation
of our relationships! I sourced two close friends to try to get all attendees and their relationships, as well as our core friend group that was related. See the original
PDF I made!

# Turning My Presentation into a Code Graph
At Hackbright Academy Engineering Bootcamp, we were learning about turing Linked Lists into Graphs. I couldn't help but remember my pointless presentation
I made two months earlier! I knew I had to convert my PDF graph into a code graph!
